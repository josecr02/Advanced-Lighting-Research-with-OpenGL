# Rendering Lighting with C++ and OpenGL

Latest Update: 08/07/2024

The Lighting shader has properties for Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular Lighting, completing the Phong Lighting Model. The material property has been added to the lighting fragment shader to interpret lighting on objects.
For now, I am testing lighting with different diffuse specular maps.
