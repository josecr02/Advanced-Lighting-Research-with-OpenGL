# Rendering Lighting with C++ and OpenGL

Latest Update: 14/07/2024

Current progess:

The Lighting shader has properties for Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular Lighting, completing the Phong Lighting Model. The material property has been added to the lighting fragment shader to interpret lighting on objects.
In the last updates, I've been learning about Directional Light and Point Lights, and implemented them. Recently, I've added the spotlight, which is implemented as a flashlight on the user.
- Lighting Attenuation, applying the formula below.
- Diffuse specular maps added.
- Multiple Types of light included
- Desert color
